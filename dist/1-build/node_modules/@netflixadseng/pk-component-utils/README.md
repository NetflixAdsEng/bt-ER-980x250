# Netflix Generic Source - PACKAGE

## Installation

`npm install && npm run init`

## Overview

Generic Sources are the building blocks of Monet Containers. There are several types:

* **Build Templates**
* **Web Components**
* **Packages**

Packages are NPM-style collections of Javascript. This is the most abstract type of Generic Source, meant for the development of shared, modular dependencies.

Partners who use their own frameworks can integrate GS-Packages by mapping their `package.json -> dependencies` to this GitHub repo.
