# Monet-Integrator

## Interface

### Attributes

- _exit-element_id_ : ID of element acting as clickthrough button. Clicks on this element will result in navigation to the Monet-defined `Exit_URL`.
- _backup-json-path_ : Defines a path to a backup json file. Default `backup.json`. Monet Integrator uses `backup.json` as
  default dynamic values during development, or as a failover when Monet is unable to be reached or Monet does not recognize the placement ID.

### Methods

### Events

_ready_ : Monet Integrator is ready, dynamic data is loaded, and all components are registered. Ad is ready to display.

## How to use

#### GWD

- Import monet-integrator.zip to the `Components` panel in the GWD UI.
- Drag and drop the `monet-integrator` component anywhere in your creative area.

### Non-GWD

- Use like any other web component with the interface as specified above.
- For the ready state of the ad, check for the `ready` attribute first, if it is not there, then add a listener for the `ready` event
